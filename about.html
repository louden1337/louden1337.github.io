            <p class="reg description"> hi, my name is louden</p>

            <p class="light description-small">idk how to write this without sounding corny but i really enjoy making people laugh.
                in real life, i tend to be a pretty awkward person so doing goofy shit online has became my outlet. 
                yet, in spite of all this, my internet journey's been a really good one. i've started a youtube channel that i'm committed to,
                i've learned how to write, mix and produce music; i've learned video editing, graphic design and an even greater amount of skills that i'm immensely proud of.
                all that and i'm still jobless ;(
            </p>
